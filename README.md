Creditify Africa – Credit Intelligence Engine
Overview
Creditify Africa is a credit intelligence platform designed to analyze mobile money statements (such as M-PESA PDFs) and other financial activity to assess an individual’s creditworthiness in a more inclusive and behaviorally intelligent way. 
Traditional credit scoring systems often exclude millions of informal and underserved individuals. We aim to bridge that gap by extracting behavioral, transactional and contextual data points from real world financial records and turning them into meaningful credit profiles.
Our mission is to enable fair, transparent and data driven lending decisions for African individuals and small businesses using tools grounded in behavioral economics, machine learning and contextual financial analysis.
Goal
To build an explainable, locally relevant credit scoring system that helps lenders understand the "why" behind someone's credit behavior and not just the "what."

Key Dimensions to Analyze in Money Ins

Source classification
Is the sender a business or personal number
Similar transactions are grouped together then we analyze the pattern over time
Use possible keywords to classify
Also time of transactions: Say maybe the payments range from 9AM to 8PM and are several transactions of amounts ranging from 100-1000. This could indicate a business.

Frequency and regularity of income
Daily: This is common for business owners
Weekly/ Biweekly: This could indicate casual labour or commissions
Monthly: Could indicate employment especially around the end of the month.
Random: Could indicate unreliable support or ad hoc income
Determined by calculating time intervals between transactions from the same sender.

Amount stability
Fixed amount every month could indicate salary

Volume of income streams
Single stream: This is high risk unless it is a stable one
Multiple streams: More stable and lower risk
A person earning 10K a month from 3 different sources is less risky compared to one earning 30K from a single source.

Business indicators
Payments from many different people, especially small amounts may indicate a business.
Repeated deposits from buy goods till number.
A business with 20+ customers per week has active cash flow even if each payment is small.
